# MOONS_spectro_analysis

This repo will provide python scripts for finding the focus of the MOONS spectrograph and analysing spectrograph performance.

It builds on scripts developed for cooldown 3 by William Taylor.

The tools developed here should allow quick and easy analysis of MOONS frames for future cooldowns.
